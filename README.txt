Just a little tiny continuous frequency sweep script I wrote to characterize the vibration behaviour of a speaker that was supposed to be an actuator for some mechanical contraption. Doubles as a speaker health indicator. Triples as an ear health indicator. Quadruples as a hostile energy blast against audio-sensitive people.

HEADPHONE USERS BEWARE!!
